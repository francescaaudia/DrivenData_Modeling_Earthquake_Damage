# DrivenData_Modeling_Earthquake_Damage

For my final project for the Metis Intro to Data Science course, I will be entering the competition hosted by DrivenData called Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/134/)

1. What is the question you hope to answer?
Predict the level of damage to a building in the region that was hit by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal based on aspects of building location and construction.

2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
The data has been provided by DrivenData for this competition; the data comes from surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics of the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal, and contains information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics. It is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected.

3. What do you know about the data you're using so far?
The prediction will be an ordinal variable. There are 38 features in the dataset (in addition to a building ID feature), some of which are categorical, some are binary, and others of which are numeric. These features describe something about the building and its use.

4. Why did you choose this topic?
I took a course on risk & natural disasters in college, and think the topic is really interesting. I'm curious to see what results come of this.


For Check-In #1:
1. What data have you gathered, and how did you gather it?
I am not gathering any data myself, and will only be using the data provided by this course

2. How have you explored the data and what insights have you gained as a result?

3. Will you be able to answer your question with this data, or do you need to gather more data (or adjust your question)?

4. What modeling approach are you using to answer your question?
